Card Game
-------------------------------------------------

Created at the behest of a close friend in January of 2015, this prgram simulates a trading card based off 
of the "Star Wars Trading Card Game". Complete with sound and an easy to use interface, this program allows 
the users to play a sprawling game at the comfort of there desk. It simulates a massive table top, allowing 
the user to play out massive games. With the click of a button, the user can switch sides and access a unique 
hand, deck, and retractable discard pile. For quality of life purposes, a forece counter and a properly weighted
random number generator are also included. If the user cannont finish the game in one sitting, that is not a problem; quick save and load features are also
included.
