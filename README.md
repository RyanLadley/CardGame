Card Game
-------------------------------------------------

Created at the beheast of a close friend in January of 2015, this very simple trading card based off 
of the "Star Wars Trading Card Game" Softly using Java's swing library, this program creates an open
playing field that allows the user to play as both sides of the game.

Each side has a unique hand, deck, discard pile, and numerous other features are sotred seperatly for
for each side. 

Resources (skins and sounds) will be added to this repository at a later date.
